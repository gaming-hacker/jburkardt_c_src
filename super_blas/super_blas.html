      SUPER_BLAS <br> Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
      <br> in C <br> for SUPERLU
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUPER_BLAS</b>,
      a C library which
      is a version of the BLAS, or Basic Linear 
      Algebra Subprograms, written in C, and tailored for use with the
      SUPERLU library.      
    </p>

    <p>
      The usual release of SUPER_BLAS does not include the
      full set of BLAS routines.  Most of the real level 1 routines
      are included, except for SROTG and SSWAP, and DROTG and DSWAP.
      However, only a few of the complex level 1 routines are included.
      The situation for level 2 and level 3 is more sketchy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Independent of its application with SUPERLU, the <b>SUPER_BLAS</b>
      library may be useful for programmers using C and wishing to access
      a set of BLAS routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note, however, that to promote compatibility with FORTRAN, 
      <ul>
        <li>
          all routine names are defined with a trailing underscore;
        </li>
        <li>
          all arguments are passed by address;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The BLAS are a small core library of linear algebra utilities, 
      which can be highly optimized for various architectures.  Software
      that relies on the BLAS is thus highly portable, and will typically
      run very efficiently.  The LINPACK and LAPACK linear algebra
      libraries make extensive use of the BLAS.
