      PIG_LATIN <br> An Obfuscated English-to-Pig-Latin Converter
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PIG_LATIN</b>,
      a C program which 
      converts an input
      file of English text into a file of "Pig Latin" text,
      using a very obscure programming style,
      by Don Dodson.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program was the winner, in the "Most Humorous" category, of the
      annual International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) - a contest
      you only want to win on purpose!
    </p>

    <p>
      To see why it was a winner, print out the code.  Look at it.
      Look at it a long time.  Realize that the C compiler sees nothing
      wrong with this code, and can compile it into a program that really
      does what it says it will do.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the author says:
      <blockquote><i>
        "Istha ogrampra akesta Englishwa extta aswa inputwa andwa
        anslatestra itwa intowa Igpa Atinla."
      </i></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The obfuscation is on several levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most obviously, the shape of the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Underneath that, the variable names are in Pig Latin, as are the
      names of the standard C functions, such as <b>>putchar</b>.  Even 
      <b>main</b> is written as <b>ainma</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program construction is also very obfuscated, with all of the
      code being inside the parentheses of one of the 6 <b>orfa</b> loops.

    <p>
      <pre>
        <b>pig_latin</b> &lt; <i>input</i> &gt; <i>output</i>
      </pre>
      will read the text of <i>input</i>, convert it to Pig Latin, and write the
      converted text to <i>output</i>.
