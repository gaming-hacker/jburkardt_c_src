      MATMUL <br> A Matrix Multiplication Benchmark
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATMUL</b>,
      a C program which
      compares various methods for computing the matrix product
      <pre><b>
        A * B = C.
      </b></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      MATMUL can do this for a variety of matrix sizes, and for different
      arithmetics (real, complex, double precision, integer, even logical!)
      There are many algorithms built in, including the
      simple triple DO loop (actually not so simple; there are 6 ways to
      set it up), some unrolling techniques, and the level 1 and 2 BLAS
      routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATMUL is interactive, so the user can easily pursue any
      line of inquiry that seems promising.  New algorithms or locally
      available methods are not to hard to add.
