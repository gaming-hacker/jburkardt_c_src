TETRAHEDRON_GRID_TEST:
  C version
  Test the TETRAHEDRON_GRID library.

TEST01:
  TETRAHEDRON_GRID can define a tetrahedral grid
  with N+1 points on a side, based on any tetrahedron.
  N = 10

  Tetrahedron vertices:

  Col:          0             1             2             3     
  Row

    0:        0.000000        1.000000        0.000000        0.000000
    1:        0.000000        0.000000        1.000000        0.000000
    2:        0.000000        0.000000        0.000000        1.000000

  Part of the grid point array:
