    <p>
      Because higher level languages end up as machine code, there is
      some reason to assume that you can write parts of a program in
      two different languages; what is <b>not</b> standard is the
      protocol for dealing with the differences in languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, C does not explicitly support complex data types, and
      the C mathematical library does not include the corresponding
      arithmetic support.  It's easy enough to make something that
      <i>looks</i> like a complex number in C:
      <pre>
        typedef struct ( float r, i } complex;

        complex alpha;

        alpha.r = 1.0;
        alpha.i = 2.0;
      </pre>
      but you still can't compute directly with complex numbers in C.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another commonly noticed difference between C and FORTRAN is that C
      passes scalar parameters by value, whereas FORTRAN passes all variables
      by address.  Thus, if a C routine wants to call a FORTRAN subroutine,
      it must put the reference symbol <b>&</b> in front of each scalar
      variable to ensure that FORTRAN receives what it's expecting.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if a FORTRAN routine needs to pass a scalar
      parameter to a C routine, there is no standard way to ensure that a
      value is passed rather than an address.  The only possibility is that
      some vendors have included the ability to compute the address of a
      variable in FORTRAN, sometimes by using the same <b>&</b> operator
      available in C, but this is by no means a universal option.  If the C
      routine can be rewritten, then another option is to preface such scalar
      variables with the <b>*</b> operator in the routine declaration,
      indicating that these variables are being passed into the function by
      address rather than value.  If the C routine cannot be rewritten,
      then the only other option is to try to use some of the fancier features
      added to FORTRAN90.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet another issue occurs because of things the compiler does to symbolic
      names.  In order to avoid confusion between names the user defines and
      names the compiler wants to reserve, it is common in some cases to append
      an underscore to user-defined names.  In particular, a FORTRAN compiler
      is likely to take the name of a common block, function, or subroutine,
      and first CAPITALIZE it, and then append an underscore.  This is fine,
      as long as the compiler also does the same thing when it encounters a
      line of code that tries to access the same symbolic quantity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The C compiler is likely to do no such thing.  Thus, if the user has
      written a FORTRAN routine called "fred", it may not be possible for
      a C routine to reference "fred", but it may be possible for it to make
      the connection by asking for "FRED_"!  Thus, if the C code can be
      adjusted, then the two languages may be able to work together by having
      the C code be careful about how it refers to FORTRAN symbolic
      names.  On the other hand, the FORTRAN compiler often has a switch
      that allows the user to turn off the automatic capitalization and
      underscore-postfixation, which may accomplish the same goal.
    </p>

    <p>
      For historical reasons, a C function that returns a float actually
      returns a value that is promoted to a double.  This means that it is
      not possible to write a C routine that "looks like" a FORTRAN function
      of real type.  If you do your best to write such a routine, it will
      actually behave as though it is a FORTRAN function of double precision
      type.  This is <i>not</i> a problem if the data is being passed back out
      through the argument list, rather than through the name of the routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, a FORTRAN function with COMPLEX value is equivalent
      to a C function with an extra first argument pointing to the address
      of the return value:
      <pre>
        complex function f ( x, y )
      </pre>
      could be mimicked in C by
      <pre>
        F_ ( temp, x, y )
        struct ( float r, i ) *temp;
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, a FORTRAN function which returns a CHARACTER value may be
      equivalent to a C function with two extra initial arguments giving the
      address and length of the return value:
      <pre>
        character*14 function g ( x, y )
          or
        character ( len = 14 ) function g ( x, y )
      </pre>
      could be mimicked in C by
      <pre>
        G_ ( char result[], long *length, x, y )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Analogously, passing a character variable anywhere in a FORTRAN
      argument list may be equivalent to passing the pair of values
      consisting of the character string and its length.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if you get the two parts of your program to be compatible, you still
      have to worry about what happens when you load them, because both
      FORTRAN and C provide certain auxiliary I/O and math libraries.  If
      things are going your way, you may be able to get away with using the
      FORTRAN command to load, but appending a switch to add the C
      mathematical library as well:
      <pre>
        f90 my_main.o my_sub.o -lm
      </pre>
      or, perhaps there is also a "C" library:
      <pre>
        f90 my_main.o my_sub.o -lc -lm
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are using C to load, you may need to include the appropriate
      FORTRAN libraries.  (Warning: the names of these libraries are nowhere
      near as standard as the C math library.  And the FORTRAN IO and math
      libraries may be distinct):
      <pre>
        cc my_main.o my_sub.o -lfor -lm
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      C++ supports (on purpose!) a scheme in which the names chosen
      by a user for various functions are automatically <i>mangled</i>,
      because it is assumed likely that the same name could be used
      in different namespaces, so C++ avoids ambiguity by constructing
      unique internal names when compiling.  Unfortunately, this makes
      it very difficult for programs written in other languages to
      interact with a C++ program.  One feature that can help
      is the use of the statement
      <pre>
        external "C" { (list of function declarations) }
      </pre>
      in a C++ program in which name mangling is to be deactivated.
      The list of function declarations can be either the names of
      C routines to be called from this C++ routine, OR the names
      of internal C++ routines that are to be called by an external
      C routine.

      <b>EX1</b> shows how a C main program can call a FORTRAN90 subroutine.
      The C main program calls the FORTRAN90 routines by their exact names,
      without appending an underscore.  It is assumed that the FORTRAN compiler
      will be called in such a way that no underscores will be added to
      the compiled names.
