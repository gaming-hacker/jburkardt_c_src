TRIANGULATION_TRIANGLE_NEIGHBORS.
  C version:
  Read a node dataset of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangulation dataset of 
  TRIANGLE_NUM triangles using 3 or 6 nodes.

  For each triangle, determine the indices of the
  triangles opposite vertices 1, 2 and 3.

  Write this triangle neighbor data to files.

MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.
