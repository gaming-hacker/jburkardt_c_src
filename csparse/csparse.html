      CSPARSE <br> A Concise Sparse Matrix Package in C
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CSPARSE</b>,
      a C library which 
      implements a number of direct methods for sparse linear systems,
      by Timothy Davis.
    </p>

    <p>
      CSPARSE uses the Compressed Column (CC) format for storing the
      sparse matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithms contained in CSPARSE have been chosen with 
      five goals in mind:
      <ol>
        <li>
          they must embody much of the theory behind sparse matrix algorithms,
        </li>
        <li>
          they must be either asymptotically optimal in their run time
          and memory usage or be fast in practice,
        </li>
        <li>
          they must be concise so as to be easily understood and short 
          enough to print in the book,
        </li>
        <li>
          they must cover a wide spectrum of matrix operations,
        </li>
        <li>
          they must be accurate and robust.
        </li>
      </ol>
      The focus is on direct methods; iterative methods and solvers for
      eigenvalue problems are beyond the scope of this package.
