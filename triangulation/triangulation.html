      TRIANGULATION <br> Triangulation of 2D data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION</b>,
      a C library which
      computes a triangulation of
      a set of points in 2D, and carries out various other related
      operations on triangulations of order 3 or 6.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mesh is the collection of triangles.  Each triangle
      is termed an "element".  The points used to define the shape of the
      triangle (the corners, and sometimes a few more points) are called
      the "nodes".
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines are available to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          evaluate "quality measures" for the mesh;
        </li>
        <li>
          create a "node neighbor array" for each node;
        </li>
        <li>
          create an "element neighbor array" for each element;
        </li>
        <li>
          estimate the integral of a function over the region covered by the mesh;
        </li>
        <li>
          plot the nodes and elements of a mesh;
        </li>
        <li>
          determine the parts of the mesh that lie on the boundary;
        </li>
        <li>
          sample points at random from the region covered by the mesh;
        </li>
        <li>
          search a mesh to determine which element contains a point.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since triangulations are often used to define a finite element
      mesh, which in turn defines a sparse matrix, there are routines
      available which can define the sparse compressed column arrays
      needed for a sparse matrix associated with a mesh of order 3
      or 6.  The special case of the Taylor-Hood mixed element is also
      handled, which is essentially an order 6 grid counted twice
      and an order 3 grid that only uses the vertices of the order 6 grid.
