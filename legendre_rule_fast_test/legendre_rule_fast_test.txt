LEGENDRE_RULE
  C version

  Compiled on Jan 20 2020 at 12:58:16.

  Compute a Gauss-Legendre rule for approximating

    Integral ( a <= x <= b ) f(x) dx

  of order N.

  The user specifies N, A, and B.

  The rule is stored in 3 files:

  * leg_oN_w.txt - the weight file
  * leg_oN_x.txt - the abscissa file.
  * leg_oN_r.txt - the region file.

  N = 15

  A = 0

  B = 2

  Elapsed time during computation was 4.1e-05 seconds.

  Weight file will be   "leg_o15_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "leg_o15_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "leg_o15_r.txt".

LEGENDRE_RULE_FAST:
  Normal end of execution.
