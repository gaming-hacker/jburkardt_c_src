POWER_METHOD_TEST
  C version:
  Test the POWER_METHOD library.

TEST01
  Use the power method on the Fibonacci2 matrix.

  Matrix order N       = 50
  Maximum iterations   = 300
  Error tolerance      = 1.000000e-06

  Number of iterations = 193
  CPU time             = 0.001557
  Estimated eigenvalue =       1.6180381955877476
  Correct value        =       1.6180339887498949
  Error                = 4.206838e-06

  Sine of angle between true and estimated vectors = 4.436194e-06

POWER_METHOD_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
