/*
  Purpose:

    MAIN is the main program for LATINIZE_TEST.

  Discussion:

    LATINIZE_TEST tests the LATINIZE library.

    The dataset is presumed to be an M by N array of real numbers,
    where M is the spatial dimension, and N is the number of sample points.

    The dataset is presumed to be stored in a file, with N records,
    one per each sample point.  (Comment records may be included, 
    which begin with '#'.)

    The program reads the data file, "latinizes" the data, and writes
    the latinized data to a new file.
