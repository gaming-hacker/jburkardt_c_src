      LAPLACE_MPI <br> Laplace's Equation in a Rectangle, Solved With MPI
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LAPLACE_MPI</b>,
      a C code which
      solves Laplace's equation in a rectangle,
      using MPI for parallel execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Laplace's equation can be thought of as a heat equation.  For a scalar
      variable <b>u(x,y)</b>, it has the form:
      <pre>
          d2 u     d2 u
       - -----  -  ----  = 0 
          dx2      dy2
      </pre>
      with the value of <b>u(x,y)</b> specified along the boundary of the rectangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code uses a finite difference scheme to solve
      Laplace's equation for a square matrix distributed over a square
      (logical) processor topology.  A complete description of the algorithm
      is found in the reference by Fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code works on the SPMD (single code, multiple data)
      paradigm.  It illustrates 2D block decomposition, nodes exchanging
      edge values, and convergence checking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each matrix element is updated based on the values of the four
      neighboring matrix elements.  This process is repeated until the data
      converges, that is, until the average change in any matrix element (compared
      to the value 20 iterations previous) is smaller than a specified value.
    </p>

    <p>
      To ensure reproducible results between runs, a red/black
      checkerboard algorithm is used.  Each process exchanges edge values
      with its four neighbors.  Then new values are calculated for the upper
      left and lower right corners (the "red" corners) of each node's
      matrix.  The processes exchange edge values again.  The upper right
      and lower left corners (the "black" corners) are then calculated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is currently configured for a 48x48 matrix
      distributed over four processors.  It can be edited to handle
      different matrix sizes or number of processors, as long as the matrix
      can be divided evenly between the processors.
