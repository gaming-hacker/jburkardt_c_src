  Purpose:

    MAIN is the main program for TASK_DIVISION_TEST.

  Discussion:

    TASK_DIVISION_TEST tests the TASK_DIVISION library.

    This program simply demonstrates how one might automate the
    assignment of T tasks to P processors, assuming that the assignment
    is to be beforehand.

    In that case, we just want to make sure that we assign each task
    to a processor, that we assign about the same number of tasks
    to each processor, and that we assign each processor a contiguous
    range of tasks, say tasks I_LO to I_HI.

    The routine that is called simulates this process.
