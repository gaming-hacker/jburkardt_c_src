/*
  Purpose:

    MAIN is the main program for the reactor shielding simulation.

  Discussion:

    This is a Monte Carlo simulation, using
    uniform random numbers, which investigates the
    effectiveness of a shield intended to absorb the
    neutrons emitted from a nuclear reactor.
   
    The reactor is modeled as a point source,
    located at (0,0,0).
   
    A particle emitted from the reactor has a random
    initial direction, and an energy selected from
    [Emin,Emax] with a 1/Sqrt(E) distribution.
   
    The shield is modeled as a wall of thickness THICK,
    extending from 0 to THICK in the X direction, and
    extending forever in the Y and Z directions.
   
    Based on the particle energy, a distance D is computed
    which measures how far the particle could travel through
    the shield before colliding.
   
    Based on the particle direction, the position is updated
    by D units.
   
    If the particle is now to the left of the shield, it is
    counted as being REFLECTED.
   
    If the particle is to the right of the shield, it is 
    counted as being ABSORBED.
   
    If the particle is inside the shield, it has COLLIDED.
    A particle that collides is either absorbed (end of story)
    or SCATTERED with a new random direction and a new (lower)
    energy.
   
    Every particle is followed from origin to its final fate,
    which is reflection, transmission, or absorption.
    At the end, a summary is printed, giving the number of
    particles with each fate, and the average energy of each
    group of particles.
   
    Increasing NTOT, the number of particles used, will improve the
    expected reliability of the results.
   
    Increasing THICK, the thickness of the shield, should 
    result in more absorptions and reflections.

  Purpose:

    DIST2C returns the distance to collision.

  Discussion:

    Assuming the particle has a given energy, and assuming it is currently
    somewhere inside the shield, it is possible to determine a typical distance
    which the particle can travel before it collides with the material of
    the shield.

    The computation of the collision distance is made by estimating a
    "cross section" (as though having more energy made the particle "bigger"
    and hence more likely to collide) and then randomly selecting a distance
    that is logarithmically distributed.

  Parameters:

    Input, double MU, the cosine of the angle between the
    particle's direction and the X axis.

    Input, double AZM, the azimuthal angle of the particle's
    direction.

    Input, double D, the distance the particle traveled.

    Input/output, double *X, *Y, *Z.  On input, the previous
    coordinates of the particle.  On output, the updated coordinates of the
    particle.
