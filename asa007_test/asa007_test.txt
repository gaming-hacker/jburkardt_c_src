ASA007_TEST:
  C version
  Test the ASA007 library.

TEST01:
  SYMINV computes the inverse of a positive
  definite symmetric matrix.
  A compressed storage format is used

  Here we look at the matrix A which is
  N+1 on the diagonal and
  N   on the off diagonals.

TEST02:
  SYMINV computes the inverse of a positive
  definite symmetric matrix.
  A compressed storage format is used

  Here we look at the Hilbert matrix
  A(I,J) = 1/(I+J-1)

  For this matrix, we expect errors to grow quickly.
