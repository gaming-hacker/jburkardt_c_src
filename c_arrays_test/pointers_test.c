  Purpose:

    pointers_test tests pointers.

  Discussion:

    This program demonstrates the use of pointers to define objects
    that can be indexed like a two-dimensional array.  Either row-major
    or column-major storage can be handled.  However, the column major
    storage means that an expression like a[i][j] refers to the i-th
    column, j-th row, in other words, what we would naturally refer
    to as A(J,I) instead!
