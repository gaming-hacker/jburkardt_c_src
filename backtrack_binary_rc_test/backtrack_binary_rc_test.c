/*
  Purpose:

    TEST01 seeks a selection of binary powers that have a given sum.

  Discussion:

    We consider the binary powers 1, 2, 4, ... 2^(n-1).

    We wish to select some of these powers, so that the sum is equal
    to a given target value.  We are actually simply seeking the binary
    representation of an integer.

    A partial solution is acceptable if it is less than the target value.

    We list the powers in descending order, so that the bactracking
    procedure makes the most significant choices first, thus quickly
    eliminating many unsuitable choices.
