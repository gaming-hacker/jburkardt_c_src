    <p>
      <b>SATISFY_MPI</b>,
      a C code which
      demonstrates, for a particular circuit, an exhaustive search
      for solutions of the circuit satisfy problem.  This version of
      the code uses MPI to carry out the solution in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem assumes that we are given a logical circuit of AND, OR and NOT
      gates, with N binary inputs and a single output.  We are to determine all
      inputs which produce a 1 as the output.
    </p>

    <p>
      The general problem is NP complete, so there is no known polynomial-time
      algorithm to solve the general case.  The natural way to search for solutions
      then is exhaustive search.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an interesting way, this is a very extreme and discrete version of
      the problem of maximizing a scalar function of multiple variables.
      The difference is that here we know that both the input and output
      only have the values 0 and 1, rather than a continuous range of real
      values!
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem was a natural candidate for parallel computation, since
      the individual evaluations of the circuit are completely independent.
