  Purpose:

    MAIN is the main program for INTERVALS.

  Discussion:

    INTERVALS uses MPI routines to multiprocess a computational task.

    We have a function F(X), an interval [XMIN,XMAX], 
    and a value N.

    We define N equally spaced points in the interval,

      X(I) = ( ( N - I     ) * XMIN 
             + (     I - 1 ) * XMAX ) 
             / ( N     - 1 )

    We thus have N-1 subintervals.

    We assume we have N processors available.

    Processor 0 is designated the master processor, assigned
    to estimating the integral of F(X) over the entire
    interval [ X(1), X(N) ].

    For I = 1 to N-1, processor I is assigned the subinterval

      [ X(I), X(I+1) ]

    and then estimates the integral Q(I) of F(X) over that
    subinterval.

    COMMUNICATION:

    Processor 0 communicates to processor I the endpoints of 
    the interval it is assigned, and the number of sample points
    to use in that interval.

    Processor I communicates to processor 0 the computed value of Q(I).
