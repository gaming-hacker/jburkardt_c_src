BUFFON - Master process:
  C version
  An MPI example program to estimate PI
  using the Buffon-Laplace needle experiment.
  On a grid of cells of  width A and height B,
  a needle of length L is dropped at random.
  We count the number of times it crosses
  at least one grid line, and use this to estimate 
  the value of PI.

  The number of processes is 4

  Cell width A =    1.000000
  Cell height B =   1.000000
  Needle length L = 1.000000
