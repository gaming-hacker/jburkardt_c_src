  Purpose:

    MAIN is the main program for DAY1.

  Discussion:

    DAY1 is exercise 3 for first day of the MPI workshop

    The instructions say:

    Process 1 computes the squares of the first 200 integers.
    It sends this data to process 3.

    Process 3 should divide the integers between 20 and 119 by 53,
    getting a real result, and passes this data back to process 1.

    * I presume the first 200 integers are the numbers 0 through 199.

    * The instructions literally mean that process 3 should look
      at integers whose VALUES are between 20 and 119.  I doubt that
      is what the instructor meant, but it's more interesting than
      simply picking the entries with index between 20 and 119,
      so that's what I'll do.

    * It is also not completely clear whether only the selected data
      should be sent back, or the entire array.  Again, it is more
      interesting to send back only part of the data.
