FILE_NAME_SEQUENCE_TEST:
  C version
  Test the FILE_NAME_SEQUENCE library.
  Demonstrate ways of generating a numeric sequence of file names.

TEST02:
  FILENAME(I) = SPRINTF ( PREFIX, I, SUFFIX )
  PREFIX = "fred"
  SUFFIX = ".txt"
  0 <= I <= 12
  Numbers do NOT include leading zeros.

     0:  "fred0.txt"
     1:  "fred1.txt"
     2:  "fred2.txt"
     3:  "fred3.txt"
     4:  "fred4.txt"
     5:  "fred5.txt"
     6:  "fred6.txt"
     7:  "fred7.txt"
     8:  "fred8.txt"
     9:  "fred9.txt"
    10:  "fred10.txt"
    11:  "fred11.txt"
    12:  "fred12.txt"

TEST03:
  FILENAME(I) = SPRINTF ( PREFIX, I, SUFFIX )
  PREFIX = "frid"
  SUFFIX = ".txt"
  99 <= I <= 105
  Numbers DO include leading zeros.

    99:  "frid0099.txt"
   100:  "frid0100.txt"
   101:  "frid0101.txt"
   102:  "frid0102.txt"
   103:  "frid0103.txt"
   104:  "frid0104.txt"
   105:  "frid0105.txt"

TEST04:
  FILENAME(I+1) = FILENAME_INC ( FILENAME(I) )
  First FILENAME = "frodo_01345_lives.txt"
  Number of filenames = 10
  Numbers may include leading zeros.

     1:  "frodo_01345_lives.txt"
     2:  "frodo_01346_lives.txt"
     3:  "frodo_01347_lives.txt"
     4:  "frodo_01348_lives.txt"
     5:  "frodo_01349_lives.txt"
     6:  "frodo_01350_lives.txt"
     7:  "frodo_01351_lives.txt"
