    <p>
      <b>TIMESTAMP</b>,
      a C library which
      can print or return the current YMDHMS date as a timestamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is useful when documenting the run of a program.  By
      including a timestamp, the output of the program will always
      contain a clear indication of when it was created.  Other
      indicators, such as the file timestamp, may be misleading
      or subject to unintentional modification.
