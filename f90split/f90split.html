      <b>f90split</b>,
      a C code which 
      reads a FORTRAN file and creates individual files for every
      blockdata, function, module, program, or subroutine in the file,
    </p>

    <p>
      Procedure <i>X</i> is put in file <i>X.f90</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Comments preceding a procedure, and not associated with a 
      preceding procedure, are included with that procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should not use the more elaborate END statements that include the
      procedure definition, such as "END FUNCTION ALPHA".
