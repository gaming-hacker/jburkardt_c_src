      C4_COMPLEX_LIB <br> A Single Precision Complex Arithmetic Utility Library
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>C4_COMPLEX_LIB</b>,
      a C library which 
      contains routines for "C4" or
      "single precision complex" arithmetic.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original C specification did not include support for complex numbers.
      Until the later C99 specification added such support, it was common for
      programmers to develop their own complex arithmetic libraries.  Despite
      the fact that these routines are now generally obsolete, the procedures
      involved can still be instructive and useful, including the use of 
      structures for the data type and the development of a variety of 
      functions to carry out the necessary arithmetic operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use the structures and functions of this library, it is necessary that
      the user's source code invoke the include file:
      <pre><code>
        # include "c4_complex_lib.h"
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This package defines a single precision complex number
      as a C <b>struct</b> whose components are <b>floats</b>:
      <pre><code>
        struct c4_complex
        {
          float real;
          float imag;
        };
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To declare a variable <b>c</b> you could use a statement like:
      <pre><code>
        struct c4_complex c;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The declaration can include an initialization:
      <pre><code>
        struct c4_complex c = { 1.0, 2.0 };
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The value of a variable <b>c</b> declared as <i>struct c4_complex</i> may 
      be examined or changed by accessing the components of the struct.  Thus,
      the initialization above could be carried out at run time by the commands:
      <pre><code>
        c.real = 1.0;
        c.imag = 2.0;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the common case when pointers are used, we declare
      <pre><code>
        struct *c4_complex c;
      </code></pre>
      and then create the variable with:
      <pre><code>
        c = ( struct c4_complex *) malloc ( sizeof ( struct c4_complex ) );
      </code></pre>
      and assign values with commands like:
      <pre><code>
        c->real = 1.0;
        c->imag = 2.0;
      </code></pre>
      and finally, release the memory associated with the variable by
      <pre><code>
        free ( c );
      </code></pre>
    </p>
