  C version
  A molecular dynamics program.

  Enter ND, the spatial dimension (2 or 3).

  Enter NP, the number of points (500, for instance).

  Enter ND, the number of time steps (500 or 1000, for instance).

  ND, the spatial dimension, is 3
  NP, the number of particles in the simulation, is 1000
  STEP_NUM, the number of time steps, is 400
  DT, the size of each time step, is 0.000100

  Initializing positions, velocities, and accelerations.

  Computing initial forces and energies.

  At each step, we report the potential and kinetic energies.
  The sum of these energies should be a constant.
  As an accuracy check, we also print the relative error
  in the total energy.
