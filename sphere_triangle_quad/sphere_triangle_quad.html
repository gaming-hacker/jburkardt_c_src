      SPHERE_TRIANGLE_QUAD <br> Estimate Integrals over Spherical Triangles
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_TRIANGLE_QUAD</b>,
      a C library which 
      estimates the integral of a scalar function 
      over the surface of a spherical triangle on the unit sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Three methods of estimation are very crude and cannot be improved:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the centroid rule, based on a single function value.
        </li>
        <li>
          the vertex rule, which averages the vertex values.
        </li>
        <li>
          the midside rule, which averages the midside values.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      One method of estimation uses random sampling, the Monte Carlo method, 
      whose accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of sample points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another method is based on the centroid rule, but allows the
      user to decompose the original spherical triangle into collection
      of smaller triangles.  The accuracy of the estimate should improve
      as the size of these triangles decreases.
