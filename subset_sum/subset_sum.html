      SUBSET_SUM <br> The Subset Sum Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUBSET_SUM</b>,
      a C library which
      seeks solutions of the subset sum problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The task is to compute a target value as the sum of
      a selected subset of a given set of weights.
    </p>

    <p>
      SUBSET_SUM_NEXT works by backtracking, returning all possible solutions
      one at a time, keeping track of the selected weights using 
      a 0/1 mask vector of size N.
    </p>

    <p>
      SUBSET_SUM_TABLE works by a kind of dynamic programming approach,
      constructing a table of all possible sums from 1 to S.  The storage
      required is N * S, so for large S this can be an issue.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      SUBSET_SUM_FIND works by brute force, trying every
      possible subset to see if it sums to the desired value.
      It uses the bits of a 32 bit integer to keep track of the 
      possibilities, and hence cannot work with more N = 31 weights.
