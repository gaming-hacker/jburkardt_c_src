      SHOWME <br> 2D Mesh Display
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SHOWME</b>,
      a C program which 
      uses the X Window library to
      display triangulations and meshes,
      by Jonathan Shewchuk.
    </p>

    <p>
      SHOWME was developed for use with the TRIANGLE
      program (which produces Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams,
      and finite element meshes).  Since data input is done through
      files with a simple format, it is easy for other programs to
      generate output that <b>SHOWME</b> can display.  SHOWME
      can also make PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript 
      graphics files of the images that it displays.
    </p>

    <p>
      SHOWME can produce documentation online.
      Complete instructions for invoking the program are
      available with the `-h' switch:
      <pre>
        showme -h
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The instructions are long; you'll probably want to pipe the output to
      <b>more</b> or redirect it to a file.  If the program is invoked
      with no arguments, it prints a short list of command options.
    </p>

    <p>
      SHOWME can read and display a number of computational
      objects.  The simplest form is a Planar Straight Line Graph
      (PSLG), which is usually stored in a POLY file.  This file contains a list of points, line
      segments, and possibly some information about holes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Try out SHOWME on the sample file, A.poly:
      <pre>
        triangle -p A.poly
        showme A.poly &
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      SHOWME will read the Planar Straight Line Graph defined 
      by A.poly, and write its constrained Delaunay triangulation to 
      A.1.node and A.1.ele.  <b>SHOWME</b> will display the figure defined by 
      A.poly.  There are two buttons marked "ele" in the window; 
      click on the top one.  This will cause <b>SHOWME</b> to load and display 
      the triangulation, if it has been computed by <b>TRIANGLE</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For contrast, try running
      <pre>
        triangle -pq A
      </pre>
      Now, click on the same "ele" button.  A new triangulation will be loaded;
      this one having no angles smaller than 20 degrees.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see a Voronoi diagram, try this:
      <pre>
        cp A.poly A.node
        triangle -v A
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Click the "ele" button again.  You will see the Delaunay triangulation 
      of the points in A.poly, without the segments.  Now click the top 
      "voro" button.  You will see the Voronoi diagram corresponding to 
      that Delaunay triangulation.  Click the "Reset" button to see the 
      whole diagram.
