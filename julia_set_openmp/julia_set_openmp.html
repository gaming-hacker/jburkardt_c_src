      <b>julia_set_openmp</b>,
      a C code which
      produces an image of a Julia set, using OpenMP to carry out the
      computation in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we have a function f(z) defined for any complex number z.  Suppose
      that we repeatedly carry out the iteration z <== f(z).  It's natural to
      assume that the sequence of z values will blow up in magnitude; however 
      it's possible that for some starting values z, the sequence will stay 
      small.  We call such points the Julia set for f().
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple class of test functions has the form f(z)=z^2+c, and some 
      interesting values of the complex number c include 0.4+0.6i, 0.285+0.01i, 
      and 0.7269+0.1889i.  For our experiment, we will use c=-0.8+0.156i$.  We 
      will only look at points in the rectangle [-1.5,+1.5]x[-1.5,+1.5].  We 
      will pick a 1000x1000 grid in this rectangle, and for each z{i,j} we will
      iterate 200 times.  If the norm of the iterates stays below 1,000, we will 
      consider that it is a member of the Julia set.  So our result will 
      essentially be a 1000x1000 array of 0's (not in the set) and 1's 
      (in the set).
    </p>

    <p>
      Every candidate point can be checked independently.  Therefore, 
      determining the stucture of a Julia set is a good candidate
      for a parallel computation.
