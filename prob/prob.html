      PROB <br> Probability Density Functions
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PROB</b>,
      a C library which
      handles various discrete and
      continuous probability density functions (PDF's).
    </p>

    <p>
      For a discrete variable X, PDF(X) is the probability that the value
      X will occur; for a continuous variable, PDF(X) is the probability
      density of X, that is, the probability of a value between X and X+dX
      is PDF(X) * dX.
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding cumulative density functions or "CDF"'s are also
      handled.  For a discrete or continuous variable, CDF(X) is the
      probability that the variable takes on a value less than or equal to X.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, the inverse of the CDF can easily be computed.
      If
      <pre><b>
        X = CDF_INV ( P )
      </b></pre>
      then we are asserting that the value <b>X</b> has a cumulative
      probability density function of <b>P</b>, in other words,
      the probability that the variable is less than or equal to <b>X</b>
      is <b>P</b>.  If the CDF cannot be analytically inverted, there
      are simple ways to try to estimate the inverse.  Depending on
      the PDF, these methods may be rapid and accurate, or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      For most distributions, the mean or "average value" or
      "expected value" is also available.  For a discrete variable, MEAN
      is simply the sum of the products X * PDF(X); for a continuous
      variable, MEAN is the integral of X * PDF(X) over the range.
      For the distributions covered here, the means are known beforehand,
      and no summation or integration is required.
    </p>

    <p>
      For most distributions, the variance is available.  For a
      discrete variable, the variance is the sum of the products
      ( X - MEAN )^2 * PDF(X); for a continuous variable, the
      variance is the integral of ( X - MEAN )^2 * PDF(X) over the range.
      The square root of the variance is known as the standard
      deviation.  For the distributions covered here, the variances are
      often known beforehand, and no summation or integration is required.
    </p>

    <p>
      For many of the distributions, it is possible to repeatedly
      request "samples", that is, a pseudorandom sequence of realizations
      of the PDF.  These samples are always associated with an integer
      seed, which controls the calculation.  Using the same seed as input
      will guarantee the same sample value on output.  Ultimately, a
      random number generator must be invoked internally.  In most cases,
      the current code will call a routine called R8_RANDOM or
      I4_RANDOM, each of which in turn calls a routine called
      R8_UNIFORM_01.  You may prefer a different random number generator
      for this purpose.
