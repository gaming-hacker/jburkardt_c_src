      <b>cnoise_test</b>,
      a C program which
      calls cnoise() to
      generate sequences that simulate 1/f^alpha power law noise.  This includes 
      white noise (alpha = 0), pink noise (alpha = 1) and red or Brownian noise (alpha = 2),
      as well as noise for values of alpha between 0 and 2.
