void lcrg_anbn ( int a, int b, int c, int n, int *an, int *bn )

/******************************************************************************/
/*
  Purpose:

    LCRG_ANBN computes the "N-th power" of a linear congruential generator.

  Discussion:

    We are considering a linear congruential random number generator.
    The LCRG takes as input an integer value called SEED, and returns
    an updated value of SEED,

      SEED(out) = ( a * SEED(in) + b ) mod c.

    and an associated pseudorandom real value

      U = SEED(out) / c.

    In most cases, a user is content to call the LCRG repeatedly, with
    the updating of SEED being taken care of automatically.

    The purpose of this routine is to determine the values of AN and BN
    that describe the LCRG that is equivalent to N applications of the
    original LCRG.

    One use for such a facility would be to do random number computations
    in parallel.  If each of N processors is to compute many random values,
    you can guarantee that they work with distinct random values
    by starting with a single value of SEED, using the original LCRG to generate
    the first N-1 "iterates" of SEED, so that you now have N "seed" values,
    and from now on, applying the N-th power of the LCRG to the seeds.

    If the K-th processor starts from the K-th seed, it will essentially
    be computing every N-th entry of the original random number sequence,
    offset by K.  Thus the individual processors will be using a random
    number stream as good as the original one, and without repeating, and
    without having to communicate.

    To evaluate the N-th value of SEED directly, we start by ignoring
    the modular arithmetic, and working out the sequence of calculations
    as follows:

      SEED(0)   =     SEED.
      SEED(1)   = a * SEED      + b
      SEED(2)   = a * SEED(1)   + b = a^2 * SEED           + a * b + b
      SEED(3)   = a * SEED(2)   + b = a^3 * SEED + a^2 * b + a * b + b
      ...
      SEED(N-1) = a * SEED(N-2) + b

      SEED(N) = a * SEED(N-1) + b = a^N * SEED
                                    + ( a^(n-1) + a^(n-2) + ... + a + 1 ) * b

    or, using the geometric series,

      SEED(N) = a^N * SEED + ( a^N - 1) / ( a - 1 ) * b
              = AN * SEED + BN

    Thus, from any SEED, we can determine the result of N applications of the
    original LCRG directly if we can solve

      ( a - 1 ) * BN = ( a^N - 1 ) * b in modular arithmetic,

    and evaluate:

      AN = a^N

  Discussion:

    This routine cannot be recommended for production use.  Because we want

    First, for efficiency, the power A**N is computed by determining
    the binary expansion of N, then computing A, A^2, A^4, and so on
    by repeated squaring, and multiplying only those factors that
    contribute to A**N.

    Secondly, the intermediate products are immediately "mod'ed", which
    keeps them small.

    For instance, to compute mod ( A^13, 11 ), we essentially compute

       13 = 1 + 4 + 8

       A**13 = A * A^4 * A^8

       mod ( A**13, 11 ) = mod ( A, 11 ) * mod ( A^4, 11 ) * mod ( A^8, 11 ).

    Fermat's little theorem says that if P is prime, and A is not divisible
    by P, then ( A^(P-1) - 1 ) is divisible by P.
