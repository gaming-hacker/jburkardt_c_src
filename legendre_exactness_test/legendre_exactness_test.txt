LEGENDRE_EXACTNESS
  C version
  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Legendre
  quadrature rule by integrating weighted
  monomials up to a given degree over the [-1,+1] interval.

  The quadrature file rootname is "leg_o4".

LEGENDRE_EXACTNESS: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "leg_o4_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "leg_o4_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "leg_o4_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check = 10

  Spatial dimension = 1
  Number of points  = 4

  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a Gauss-Legendre rule
  ORDER = 4

  Standard rule:
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) f(x) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).

  Weights W:

  w[0] = 0.347855
  w[1] = 0.652145
  w[2] = 0.652145
  w[3] = 0.347855

  Abscissas X:

  x[0] = -0.861136
  x[1] = -0.339981
  x[2] = 0.339981
  x[3] = 0.861136

  Region R:

  r[0] = -1
  r[1] = 1

  A Gauss-Legendre rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree = 7
