LAGUERRE_RULE
  C version

  Compute a Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rule for
    Integral ( A <= x < +oo ) exp(-b*(x-a)) f(x) dx
  of order N.

  The user specifies N, A, B, and FILENAME.

  N is the number of points;
  A is the left endpoint, usually 0.0:
  B is a scale factor, usually 1.0;
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
  * filename_w.txt - the weight file
  * filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
  * filename_r.txt - the region file.

  N = 4
  A = 0
  B = 1
  FILENAME = "lag_o4"

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "lag_o4"

  Weight file will be   "lag_o4_w.txt"
  Abscissa file will be "lag_o4_x.txt"
  Region file will be   "lag_o4_r.txt"

LAGUERRE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
