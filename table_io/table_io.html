    <p>
      <b>TABLE_IO</b>,
      a C library which
      reads or writes a TABLE file.
    </p>

    <p>
      A TABLE file is a simple format for storing a double-indexed
      array of data.  We regard this is a situation involving N
      points in M dimensions, with M relatively small
      (often just 2 or 3, but possibly 10 or 20) while N can
      be "enormous" (10, 100, 1,000 or 10,000).
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep things simple, then, the data is written to an ASCII
      file, with optional comment lines (which must start with the
      '#' character) and blank lines (which are ignored).  The point
      data is stored by writing the coordinates of each point on
      a separate line.  No information about M or N is 
      explicitly included in the file.
      It is up to the I/O program to determine this.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_IO</b> supplies routines by which a TABLE file can
      easily be written or read.  A typical write operation simply
      calls routine <b>R8MAT_WRITE</b>.  A typical read operation
      will probably first want to call <b>R8MAT_HEADER_READ</b>
      to determine the values of <b>M</b> and <b>N</b>, and then
      allocate space for the table, and then call <b>R8MAT_DATA_READ</b> 
      to read the data.
