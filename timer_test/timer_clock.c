/*
  Purpose:

    MAIN is the main program for TIMER_CLOCK.

  Discussion:

    TIMER_CLOCK uses CLOCK as the timer.

    CLOCK is a timing utility accessible to C codes. It returns the number of
    "ticks" of processor time devoted to the user's job.  Dividing this by
    CLOCKS_PER_SEC (the number of clock ticks per second) gives a rough value for
    the elapsed CPU time.

    In this program, we call a routine CPU_TIME, which conveniently converts
    CLOCK's output to seconds for us.
