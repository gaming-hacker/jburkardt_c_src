SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_TEST
  C version
  Test the SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH library.

TEST01
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH maps from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_INVERSE is the inverse map.
  Check that these two functions are inverses.

  Map points from sphere to plane to sphere.
  RMS difference for 100 points was 2.27002e-17

  Map points from plane to sphere to plane.
  RMS difference for 100 points was 6.98086e-18

TEST02
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH standard mapping from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH2 generalized mapping:
