    <p>
      <b>ASCII_TO_MRI</b>
      is a C program which
      reads a file containing MRI information in ASCII text format, and
      restores it to its original binary format.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually, the ASCII data was created by the program <b>mri_to_ascii</b>,
      after which it may have been modified in some way, and now needs to
      be rewritten into the MRI format.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>ascii_to_mri</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>.txt</b> is the ASCII text file containing
          the MRI information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>.dat</b> is the name of the file into which
          the program should place the binary version of the MRI information.
        </li>
      </ul>
