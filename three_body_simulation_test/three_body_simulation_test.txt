three_body_simulation
  C version
  Simulate the behavior of three bodies which are
  constrained to lie in a plane, moving under the
  influence of gravity.
 
  Use RKF45 for the ODE integrator.

three_body_simulation_RUN
  Simulate the planar three-body problem as an ODE system
  using RKF45 for the ODE integration.
