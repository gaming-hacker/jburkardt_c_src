MM_IO_TEST
  C version
  Test the MM_IO library.

TEST01:
  MM_READ_BANNER reads the header line of
    a Matrix Market file.

  Reading "matrix_05_05_crg.txt".

  MM_typecode[0] = M
  MM_typecode[1] = C
  MM_typecode[2] = R
  MM_typecode[3] = G

TEST02:
  MM_READ_MTX_ARRAY_SIZE reads the sizes line of
    an MM matrix file;
  MM_READ_MTX_CRD_SIZE reads the sizes line of
    an MM coordinate file;

  Reading "matrix_05_05_crg.txt".

  Coordinate sizes:
    M  = 5
    N  = 5
    NZ = 10

TEST02:
  MM_READ_MTX_ARRAY_SIZE reads the sizes line of
    an MM matrix file;
  MM_READ_MTX_CRD_SIZE reads the sizes line of
    an MM coordinate file;

  Reading "matrix_05_05_arg.txt".

  error = 0
  Array sizes:
    M = 5
    N = 5
