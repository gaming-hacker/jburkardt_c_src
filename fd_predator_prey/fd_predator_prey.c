  Purpose:

    FD_PREDATOR_PREY solves a pair of predator-prey ODE's.

  Discussion:

    The physical system under consideration is a pair of animal populations.

    The PREY reproduce rapidly; for each animal alive at the beginning of the
    year, two more will be born by the end of the year.  The prey do not have
    a natural death rate; instead, they only die by being eaten by the predator.
    Every prey animal has 1 chance in 1000 of being eaten in a given year by
    a given predator.

    The PREDATORS only die of starvation, but this happens very quickly.
    If unfed, a predator will tend to starve in about 1/10 of a year.
    On the other hand, the predator reproduction rate is dependent on
    eating prey, and the chances of this depend on the number of available prey.

    The resulting differential equations can be written:

      PREY(0) = 5000
      PRED(0) =  100

      d PREY / dT =    2 * PREY(T) - 0.001 * PREY(T) * PRED(T)
      d PRED / dT = - 10 * PRED(T) + 0.002 * PREY(T) * PRED(T)

    Here, the initial values (5000,100) are a somewhat arbitrary starting point.

    The pair of ordinary differential equations that result have an interesting
    behavior.  For certain choices of the interaction coefficients (such as
    those given here), the populations of predator and prey will tend to
    a periodic oscillation.  The two populations will be out of phase; the number
    of prey will rise, then after a delay, the predators will rise as the prey
    begins to fall, causing the predator population to crash again.

    In this program, the pair of ODE's is solved with a simple finite difference
    approximation using a fixed step size.  In general, this is NOT an efficient
    or reliable way of solving differential equations.  However, this program is
    intended to illustrate the ideas of finite difference approximation.

    In particular, if we choose a fixed time step size DT, then a derivative
    such as dPREY/dT is approximated by:

      d PREY / dT = approximately ( PREY(T+DT) - PREY(T) ) / DT

    which means that the first differential equation can be written as

      PREY(T+DT) = PREY(T) + DT * ( 2 * PREY(T) - 0.001 * PREY(T) * PRED(T) ).

    We can rewrite the equation for PRED as well.  Then, since we know the
    values of PRED and PREY at time 0, we can use these finite difference
    equations to estimate the values of PRED and PREY at time DT.  These values
    can be used to get estimates at time 2*DT, and so on.  To get from time
    T_START = 0 to time T_STOP = 5, we simply take STEP_NUM steps each of size
    DT = ( T_STOP - T_START ) / STEP_NUM.

    Because finite differences are only an approximation to derivatives, this
    process only produces estimates of the solution.  And these estimates tend
    to become more inaccurate for large values of time.  Usually, we can reduce
    this error by decreasing DT and taking more, smaller time steps.

    In this example, for instance, taking just 100 steps gives nonsensical
    answers.  Using STEP_NUM = 1000 gives an approximate solution that seems
    to have the right kind of oscillatory behavior, except that the amplitude
    of the waves increases with each repetition.  Using 10000 steps, the
    approximation begins to become accurate enough that we can see that the
    waves seem to have a fixed period and amplitude.
