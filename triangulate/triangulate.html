      TRIANGULATE <br> Triangulate a Polygonal Region
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATE</b>,
      a C program which
      triangulates a polygonal region, 
      by Joseph O'Rourke.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The polygon is defined by an input file which gives the coordinates
      of the nodes of the polygon.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the calculation is to be exact, the coordinates are expected 
      to be integers.  This requirement may cause problems!
    </p>

    <p>
      No consecutive pair of vertices should be equal; when describing a
      polygon, sometimes the first and last vertices are equal.  For this
      program, that is not the case.  To describe a square, your input
      file should contain four pairs of coordinates, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vertices should be listed in counterclockwise order.  If you list
      them in clockwise order, then the area will probably come out negative,
      and the program will refuse to proceed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible to create a "polygon" that has zero area.  The program
      will refuse to process such an object.
    </p>

    <p>
      The polygon does not need to be convex.  However, you should be careful
      not to specify a polygon which crosses itself, since this means the
      interior of the polygon is not well defined, and hence a triangulation
      is not well defined.  As a simple example of such a problem, consider
      the four vertices of a square in counterclockwise order: V1, V2, V3, V4,
      and list them instead as V1, V3, V2, V4.  This shape cannot be triangulated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The output of the program is a PostScript file which shows the
      polygon and its triangulation.  The text of the PostScript file
      includes comments that describe the triangulation in terms of
      the pairs of vertices that were connected to make each diagonal.
