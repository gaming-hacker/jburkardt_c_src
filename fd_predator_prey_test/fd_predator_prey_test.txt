FD_PREDATOR_PREY
  C version

  A finite difference approximate solution of a pair
  of ordinary differential equations for a population
  of predators and prey.

  The exact solution shows wave behavior, with a fixed
  period and amplitude.  The finite difference approximation
  can provide a good estimate for this behavior if the stepsize
  DT is small enough.

  Initial time    = 0.000000
  Final time      = 5.000000
  Initial prey    = 5000.000000
  Initial pred    = 100.000000
  Number of steps = 100
  T, R, F values written to "trf_100.txt".
