dijkstra_test
  C version
  Test dijkstra(), using Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the minimum
  distance from node 0 to each node in a graph,
  given the distances between each pair of nodes.

  Distance matrix:

    0   40   15  Inf  Inf  Inf
   40    0   20   10   25    6
   15   20    0  100  Inf  Inf
  Inf   10  100    0  Inf  Inf
  Inf   25  Inf  Inf    0    8
  Inf    6  Inf  Inf    8    0

  Minimum distances from node 0:

   0   0
   1  35
   2  15
   3  45
   4  49
   5  41
