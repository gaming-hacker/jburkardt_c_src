FEM1D_PROJECT
  C version.

  Read files defining a sampling of a function of 1 argument.
  Read files defining a finite element mesh.
  Project the sample data onto the mesh, and
  write a file of FEM coefficient values.

  Sample node spatial dimension is 1
  Sample node number is            11
  The SAMPLE value dimension is    3
  the SAMPLE value number is        11

  The FEM node dimension is        1
  The FEM node number is           6
  The FEM element order is         2
  The FEM element number is        5

  Projected FEM values written to "fem_powers_values.txt"

FEM1D_PROJECT
  Normal end of execution.
