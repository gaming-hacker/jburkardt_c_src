      PRODUCT_RULE <br> Multidimensional Quadrature Rule Creation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PRODUCT_RULE</b>,
      a C program which
      creates a multidimensional quadrature rule by using
      a product of distinct one-dimensional quadrature rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program reads a single input file, which contains a list
      that defines the 1D rules to be used as factors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each 1D rule is stored in three files, an "X", "W", and "R" file,
      which are assumed to share a common filename prefix, so that
      the files defined by a given <i>prefix</i> have the form:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>x.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>w.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>r.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, let us suppose we want to compute a 2D product rule
      formed from a 3 point Clenshaw Curtis rule and a 2 point
      Gauss-Legendre rule.  If the prefixes for these files were
      "cc_d1_o003" and "gl_d1_o002" respectively, then the input
      file to the program would read as follows:
      <pre>
        cc_d1_o003
        gl_d1_o002
      </pre>
      When the program read the first 1D rule, it would be searching for
      three files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>cc_d1_o003_x.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>cc_d1_o003_w.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>cc_d1_o003_r.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      and similarly for the second file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the program has computed the multidimensional product rule,
      it again writes out three files describing the product rule,
      with a common filename prefix specified by the user, which
      might be, for instance, <i>product</i>, in which case the files
      would be:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>product_x.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>product_w.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>product_r.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>product_rule</b> ( <i>list_file</i>, <i>product_prefix</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>list_file</i> is the name of the file containing the list of filename
          prefixes that can be used to locate the X, W and R files
          of each 1D quadrature rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>product_prefix</i> is the prefix to be used when writing out the X, W and R
          files of the computed multidimensional product rule.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the arguments are not supplied on the command line, the
      program will prompt for them.
