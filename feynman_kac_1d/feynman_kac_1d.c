  Purpose:

    MAIN is the main program for FEYNMAN_KAC_1D.

  Discussion:

    This program is derived from section 2.5, exercise 2.2 of Petersen 
    and Arbenz.

    The problem is to determine the solution U(X) of the following 
    partial differential equation:

      (1/2) Laplacian U - V(X) * U = 0,

    inside the domain D:
 
      D = { X | (X/A)^2 <= 1 }
   
    with the boundary condition U(boundary(D)) = 1.

    V(X) is the potential function:

      V = 2 * ( (X/A^2)^2 + 1/A^2.

    The analytic solution of this problem is already known:

      U(X) = exp ( (X/A)^2 - 1 ).

    Our method is via the Feynman-Kac Formula.

    The idea is to start from any x in D, and
    compute x+Wx(t) where 1D Brownian motion
    Wx is updated each step by sqrt(h)*z,
    each z is an independent approximately Gaussian 
    random variable with zero mean and variance 1. 

    Each x1(t) is advanced until x1(t) exits the domain D.  

    Upon its first exit from D, the sample path x1 is stopped and a 
    new sample path at x is started until N such paths are completed.
 
    The Feynman-Kac formula gives the solution here as

      U(X) = (1/N) sum(1 <= I <= N) Y(tau_i),

    where

      Y(tau) = exp( -int(s=0..tau) v(x1(s)) ds),

    and tau = first exit time for path x1. 

    The integration procedure is a second order weak accurate method:

      X(t+h)  = x1(t) + sqrt ( h ) * z

    Here Z is an approximately normal univariate Gaussian. 

    An Euler predictor approximates Y at the end of the step

      Y_e     = (1 - h*v(X(t)) * Y(t), 

    A trapezoidal rule completes the step:

      Y(t+h)  = Y(t) - (h/2)*[v(X(t+h))*Y_e + v(X(t))*Y(t)].
