      PBMLIB - Portable Bit Map (PBM) Graphics
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PBMLIB</b>,
      a C library which 
      creates and reads Portable Bit Map (PBM) graphics files.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Both ASCII and binary PBM formats are supported.  The library can also handle
      the related Portable Gray Map (PGM) and Portable Pixel Map
      (PPM) formats.  
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many graphics programs, such as XV and GIMP, that can
      display images in these formats, or translate them to other formats
      such as BMP, GIF, JPEG, MacPaint, X Window, and so on.
